Please install live-server by npm-install-live-server
And then navigate to the folder containing index.html and run live-server to initialize a live-server.

Any changes made in the live-server can be viewed immediately without user refresh.

Made a small server using node.js for server side rendering.

Would submit the whole code once done.
